<h1>3D printed pneumatic parts</h1>

<p>
	Off the shelf sizes and shapes of pneumatic joints are limited so I tried to
	3D print a simple one to test how well it can hold a vacuum. Joint was printed
	as a simple cylinder with standard 20% infill using clear PLA. No thread was
	printed inside cylinder. I hand tightened 1/8" BSP thread pneumatic fittings
	to it:

	Bellow is a video testing if 3D printed pneumatic joint is good enough for a
	robot to hang on a plaster wall:

<p>
	Even without proper measuring it is obvious that 3D printed pneumatic joint is
	usable for this application so it might allow to replace some of metal
	pneumatic parts with lighter plastic parts in the future.
