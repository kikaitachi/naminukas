<h1>Rubber foam vacuum suction cup</h1>
<h2>2020-09-06</h2>
<p>
	I was looking for foam rubber vacuum suction cups for a while with an
	ultimate goal to enable naminukas to climb a brick wall. I am still
	not sure if that is possible as I couldn't get hold of foam rubber
	suction	cup of suitable size and without heavy metal plate. To convince
	myself if it is the direction worth pursuing I have build a suction cup
	from a cheap self adhesive neoprene foam rubber sheet from eBay and 3D
	printed	decommissioned naminukas' parts:

	Cut with a hobby craft knife it doesn't look nice but it is good enough for
	testing. It does stick well to smooth and hard surfaces. It also sticks
	to pavement tiles and some outdoor concrete surfaces to which regular
	rubber cups wouldn't stick at all. Holding force is not enough to lift
	a robot but it is also smaller size than I would like to use. So while
	this cup doesn't stick to bricks at all I think overall this design
	looks promising. Next step is to test larger diameter cup and softer
	rubber foam if I can find one.
