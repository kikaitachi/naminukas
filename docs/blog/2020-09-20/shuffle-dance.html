	I am looking to pivot my career towards robotics. It seems these days
	all robotics related companies are using Python. Currently naminukas
	software is written in C with some parts in C++ in order to use C++
	libraries like PCL. This week I set myself a challenge to make a
	standalone Python program to make naminukas to do something useful or
	entertaining. Here is a result:

	To make this video I also wrote <a href="https://github.com/kikaitachi/python2video">scripts</a>
	to capture Python program execution trace with timestamps and convert
	it to an accurate video	of which line is executed when. Obviously for
	most programs real-time video would be too fast to see anything but
	since the robot sleeps a lot between actions it is actually possible to
	see which lines are being executed.
