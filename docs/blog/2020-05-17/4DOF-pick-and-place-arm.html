<h1>4DOF pick & place arm</h1>
<h2>2020-05-17</h2>
<p>
	Doorstep can be quite a formidable obstacle for a small robot. It can
	be too tall to drive over and too wide to step over. Luckily naminukas
	has few more cards in its sleeve. Having 2 degrees of freedom in each
	feet and pneumatic suction cups, it can act as a 4DOF pick & place arm!
	And not just any arm - an arm which can pick and place with both ends.
	See how naminukas acting as an arm builds a bridge to cross to the
	other side of the doorstep:
