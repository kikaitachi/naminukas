<h1>Lighter vacuum suction cup</h1>
<h2>2020-04-12</h2>
<p>
	Robot uses 95mm diameter silicone vacuum suction cups. They weight 125g
	each which is quite heavy compared to other parts. Most of weight comes
	from a metal plate embedded in a suction cup. Before working on this
	project I didn't have any experience with pneumatic / vacuum systems so
	after a lot for googling I bought 2 different cups for testing. Both of
	them had a heavy metal plate inside. I couldn't find any seller
	advertising "light" suction cups. Since "heavy" ones were not too heavy
	for a robot to lift, I just used them. After successful test with
	<a href="/blog/2020-03-29/3D-printed-pneumatic-parts">3D printed pneumatic joint</a>
	I tried to 3D print vacuum suction cup too. I have never printed with a
	soft filament and I didn't have a soft filament at hand so I 3D
	printed a cup from PLA and instead of a soft lip I used a rubber
	o-ring.	It worked on flat hard surfaces but not at all on plaster wall.
	Potentially softer material o-ring could work but I found a suction cup
	to buy with a detachable metal plate so I reprinted whole cup and wheel
	assembly. Old one was 140g:

<p>
	New one is 73g - almost twice lighter:

</div>
<p>
	New wheel not only looks cooler but also has o-ring rubber tire in
	order not to slip on hard surfaces:

	Here are assembly steps. Leg without cup / wheel:

	With spacer:

	With bevel gear:

<p>
	With holding screws:

	<img class="image" src="leg-with-holding-screws.jpg" alt="Robot leg with holding screws added"/>
</div>
<p>
	With rotary joint directly screwed in 3D printed part (tread was printed):
</p>
<div class="imageContainer">
	<img class="image" src="leg-with-rotary-joint.jpg" alt="Robot leg with rotary joint added"/>
</div>
<p>
	With pneumatic tube connected:
</p>
<div class="imageContainer">
	<img class="image" src="leg-with-pneumatic-tube.jpg" alt="Robot leg with pneumatic tube added"/>
</div>
<p>
	In wheel mode:
</p>
<div class="imageContainer">
	<img class="image" src="leg-in-wheel-mode.jpg" alt="Robot leg in wheel mode"/>
</div>
<p>
	Overall robot weight was reduced from 1470 to 1405g:
</p>
<div class="imageContainer">
	<img class="image" src="overall-weight.jpg" alt="Overall robot weight"/>
</div>
<p>
	Overall weight reduction of 65g doesn't match with wheel assembly
	reduction of 67g but
	<a href="https://amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01D9SQKJY/?tag=wishinfinit09-21">kitchen scales</a>
	are obviously not very accurate.
</p>
<p>
	I have ordered a new suction cup for the other leg too. I can operate
	robot with different legs for now as new one is only few millimeters
	higher than the old one. Both suction cups and PLA parts are quite
	flexible so in "normal" operations robot shape distorts more than
	few millimeters. I have more improvements in mind for legs but they
	require	reprinting lots of other parts and I feel I haven't explored
	all I can learn from current prototype.
