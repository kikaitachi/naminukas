<h1>Robot writes with its feet</h1>
<h2>2020-05-24</h2>
<p>
	Last week it was demonstrated how naminukas can <a href="/blog/2020-05-17/4DOF-pick-and-place-arm">act as 4DOF pick and place arm</a>.
	This week I finished making a detachable tool mechanism. Goal was to
	allow robot arm to use different tools without adding any additional
	actuators to minimise complexity. Idea was to exploit the fact that in
	many cases robot arms don't utilise their full possible workspace.
	Putting tools in these "unused" areas allows robot arm itself to be
	used as actuator to attach/detach tool to arm.
</p>
<p>
	I experimented with various sliding, snapping and magnetic ways to
	attach tool to arm and came up with a hybrid sliding and magnetic
	design. Here is a demonstration of mechanism in action:

</div>
<p>
	While detachable tool mechanism was made specifically for naminukas
	it is generic enough to be applied to any robot arm so I will explain
	in more details how it works:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Tool holder contains a simple flat rectangular magnet and 2
		pins on one side:
		<div class="imageContainer">
			<img class="image" src="tool-holder.png" alt="Tool holder"/>
		</div>
		Above is a holder for 3 tools. Magnets are not shown. Pins are
		made of screws screwed into round holes. Long holes at the back
		are used to attach tool holder to arm.
	</li>
	<li>
		Tool also contains a flat rectangular magnet but on one side of
		magnet holding frame there is a little rise/rail which can
		slide into corresponding depression on the arm:
		<div class="imageContainer">
			<img class="image" src="tool.png" alt="Tool"/>
		</div>
		Hole at the right is for a magnet. Hole at the left is to camp
		a tool.
	</li>
	<li>
		Arm has a flat magnet and a depression for tool to be slid into:
		<div class="imageContainer">
			<img class="image" src="arm.png" alt="Arm"/>
		</div>
		In this case arm is foot and wheel at the same time. One side
		to rail has wider opening for tool to slide easier in case of
		misalignment.
	</li>
	<li>
		Pins on tool holder and arm on the same side but interleaving
		meaning that arm can pass tool holder without touching it.
		Function of the pins is to move tool far enough so that tool
		magnet deterministically attracts more either holder or arm.
		To take tool, arm approaches from pin side, pushes tool to
		other side with arm pins and then retracts with tool stuck to
		arm. To return tool, arm approaches from pinless side and then
		pins of holder retain tool as arm moves further to side with
		pins. This mechanism would work even if tool and arm would not
		have a little rail ridges. Rail function is not to help
		take/return function but to keep tool in arm with a greater
		force than magnet could do. Technically magnets are not needed.
		Adding rail to holder side and using either friction of some
		snapping pins would work too but it would require good
		precision while magnet auto centres itself and is compliant.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	All parts were printed in PLA. Magnets used are 4x4x15mm. They are held
	in place by friction by precise sizing of the holes. As mentioned above
	pins are made of random screws laying around the house:

</div>
<p>
	Getting arm/foot to pick and return tool reliably took quite a few
	trial and error cycles. These are all 3D printed parts which didn't
	work as expected:
