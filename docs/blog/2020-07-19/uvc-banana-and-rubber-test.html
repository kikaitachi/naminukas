<h1>UVC banana and rubber test</h1>
<h2>2020-07-19</h2>
<p>
	Last week I have added a small UVA+UVC LED to naminukas. While I
	emphasized in the video that disinfecting function is just a proof of
	concept and in the final product more powerful ultraviolet lamps should
	be used, I got a few comments saying that a lot of UVC LEDs are fake
	and I should do a banana test. Banana skin is supposed to get darker
	under UVC light. While testing with bananas I also noticed that nitrile
	rubber tire near LED got cracked:

</div>

<p>
	Hopefully that proves that from sufficiently short distance my LED
	would kill bacteria too. I will need to replace rubber tire with
	silicone which is UV resistant.
</p>
<p>
	On the next day, an area surrounding darkened spot got darker too:

</div>
<p>
	I wonder if it is because of stray UV light or the original spot
	caused surrounding area to ripen faster.
