<h1>Robot skateboards on a glass ramp</h1>
<h2>2020-07-26</h2>
<p>
	Since naminukas in its current form is not very suitable for outdoor
	usage I was brainstorming solutions for a while now. One of options
	considered was to utilize a skateboard. For testing I made the simplest
	skateboard I could image. Wheels of prototype skateboard can't even be
	steered. To simulate uphill and downhill track I made a simple ramp
	from 4 pieces of old shower screen glass. This glass is supper strong
	and I tested that it can even survive a hit by a hammer. Here is a
	result of my initial experiments:

</div>
<p>
	As you can notice in the video robot can't even drive up to the very
	top of the ramp. Wheel starts slipping at some point. So before trying
	outdoors I need to upgrade tires. One of ideas I have is to try using
	inverted timing belt as a wide tire.
