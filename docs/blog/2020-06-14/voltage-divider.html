<h1>Voltage divider</h1>
<h2>2020-06-14</h2>
<p>
	In the <a href="/blog/2020-05-31/hanging-from-ceiling">previous blog entry</a>
	I described 3 methods to detect if vacuum suction cup is stuck to the
	surface:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Add pressure sensor to each feet</li>
	<li>Try to lift a foot and observe motor current change</li>
	<li>Add microphone and listen for a pump noise change</li>
</ol>
<p>
	This week I experimented with option 2 but ran into several problems.
	First of all lifting feet doesn't necessary need force depending on
	robot orientation. Imagine robot on ceiling or wall, i.e. sometimes
	force is needed to keep foot on the surface and sometimes force is
	needed to keep foot above the surface. Second problem is that 3D
	printed parts make robot quite flexible which means that the same
	commanded angle will not result in the same distance between foot and
	the surface, i.e. distance will depend on robot orientation. Third
	problem is that putting too much stress on Dynamixel servo motors
	puts them in fault mode and makes them uncontrollable without reset.
	Therefore I put current measurement approach on hold and thought of one
	more option.
</p>
<p>
	Vacuum pump I use provides a motor speed feedback by sending six 5 volt
	pulses per revolution. It seems logical to assume that, depending on
	vacuum pressure, pump RPM would drop and should be a definite indicator
	that suction cup is firmly stuck to the surface. This seemed like a
	quick win solution. BeagleBone Blue has quadrature encoder inputs and
	quick googling

	suggested that they can be reconfigured to read single pulses too. So I
	needed only few software tweaks and a voltage divider to convert 5V
	signal from pump to 3.3V signal accepted by BeagleBone Blue.

<p>
	After few days of trial and error I had to admit defeat :( Officially I
	blame my 20<sup>th</sup> century test equipment:

	In reality my electronics skills are lacking. Having an oscilloscope
	wouldn't hurt though. It is now definitely on my to buy list.
