<h1>Robot climbs the slide and gazes upon the sky</h1>
<h2>2020-06-21</h2>
<p>
	This week I have added a camera to naminukas. It doesn't do anything
	useful for autonomy yet and just captures images. Initially I used
	OpenCV library but apparently version 3.2 which is default on Debian
	Buster has a memory leak so robot runs out of memory in a few hours of
	continuous image capture. Therefore I re-implemented image capture using
	video4linux library which is way more complicated than using OpenCV but
	on the other hand more convenient for me as rest of my code is in C but
	modern versions of OpenCV require using C++. To convince myself that
	all memory leaks were eradicated I kept robot running for multiple
	hours capturing images. I have made a time-lapse video from one of
	these test runs:
