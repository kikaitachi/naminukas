<h1>Half drive mode</h1>

	Recently I have been drying figs on an oven wire grill and realized
	that a wire grill is quite a difficult terrain for a robot to traverse.
	I have unsuccessfully tried several approaches and then remembered what
	I call "half drive" mode. In this way of operation robot tilts one
	vacuum suction cup to drive mode and one stays on the ground. Tilted
	cup can drive in a circular trajectory while untilted one provides
	stability. I originally experimented with such way of locomotion when
	robot tried to conquer a <a href="https://naminukas.kikaitachi.com/blog/2020-05-17/4DOF-pick-and-place-arm">doorstep</a>
	but had no success at that time. Now I finally have an application for
	"half drive" mode:
