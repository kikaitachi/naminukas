<h1>Detecting carpet</h1>
<h2>2020-04-19</h2>
<p>
	I have started working on autonomously detecting surface unsuitable for
	a vacuum suction cups. Bellow is a video of robot walking straight
	until it fails to grip on a carpet and then turns back:
</p>
<div class="youTubeContainer">
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zK_NgYY9M0g" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>
	As you can see at the end of the video robot fails to grip on the hard
	floor once too and changes direction after that. Currently robot
	doesn't have any pressure sensors so can't directly detect when cup is
	firmly attached to the surface and must rely on hard coded timings when
	to decide that leg can be lifted.
</p>
<p>
	Carpet detection works utilizing inertial measurement unit of
	<a href="https://amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07D14WHYW/?tag=wishinfinit09-21">BeagleBone Blue</a>.
	Before turning, when one of the legs is supposed to be at the highest
	point, it checks if robot is tilted to the right direction. If robot
	failed to attach to the floor it would be tilted to the opposite
	direction because foot would be still tilted lifting opposite side of
	the body than the leg which was supposed to be in the air.
</p>
<p>
	I also couldn't resist temptation to make some mechanical improvements
	this week. I reprinted bevel gears multiple times to get backlash as
	small as I could while still allowing gears to move freely. Number of
	cable extensions was reduced. I also changed plates connecting servos
	to the thicker ones to minimise body twisting while lifting leg. New
	plate also contains embedded nuts to simplify assembly:

<p>
	Unfortunately while replacing plates connecting servos I found that 2
	of the servos were leaking some fluid:

</div>
<p>
	I don't know what kind of fluid it is. Most obvious source would be a
	grease from a gear box. It is not clear why both servos affected are on
	the side which experiences less load. If anyone has any ideas what it
	could be please <a href="/contact">contact</a> me. These servos are
	new ordered for this particular project and I don't want to loose them
	after using them just for a few months. After all they are
	<a href="https://amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01N9ZY5KE/?tag=wishinfinit09-21">the most expensive part</a>
	of this project.
