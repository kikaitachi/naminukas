<h1>The most utility per servo robot</h1>
<h2>2020-09-13</h2>
<p>
	In <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/09/11/hackaday-podcast-084-awful-floppy-disk-music-watching-a-robot-climb-walls-a-futuristic-undersea-lab-and-inside-a-digital-pregnancy-test/">HACKADAY PODCAST 084</a>
	naminukas was called the most utility per servo robot. Indeed, I did not
	add a single new actuator to the robot since its first prototype that
	could only walk. Since then, a number of robot's behaviours have exploded. Naminukas was
	selected as a finalist in <a href="https://hackaday.io/contest/171491-supplyframe-designlab-2020-hackaday-prize">Supplyframe DesignLab: 2020 Hackaday Prize</a>.
	For an attempt to win the first place I made a video which summarises
	all robot's features so far:

	It is almost its anniversary too. Last year in October I ordered the
	first parts for naminukas robot. I didn't expect to get this far. I told
	my wife that this will probably be the most expensive useless robot,
	but she let me build it anyway. It is by far the most expensive robot I've
	ever made but now I am starting to see that it could be useful after
	all. My original intent was to make an indoor robot which could act as
	a mobile security camera to check around the house while on holidays.
	Potentially with additional capabilities like remotely controlling
	the robot to go to the internet router and reset it and similar
	tasks. Now I think it has the potential of becoming an industrial
	inspection robot, cleaning robot, kitchen helper, entertainment robot and much more. I
	couldn't have succeeded without the community support, kind words, advice
	and encouragement in the comments on various media channels. Thank you everyone!
	I hope my work gives back to the community by inspiring others to start
	new or continue existing great projects.
