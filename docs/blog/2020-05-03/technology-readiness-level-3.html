<h1>Technology readiness level 3</h1>
<h2>2020-05-03</h2>
<p>
	This week naminukas reached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level">technology readiness level</a> 3.
	I was controlling robot with one hand and filming with the other so
	video is not award winning but it is the first time robot demonstrates
	all 3 operating modes (walking, driving, climbing):

<p>
	There were quite a few setbacks though. After recent software
	refactoring Dynamixels would randomly act strangely. In particular
	one of the servo would move beyond 90 degrees while transforming to
	drive mode and start scratching
	<a href="https://amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07D14WHYW/?tag=wishinfinit09-21">BeagleBone Blue</a>
	board, eventually breaking one of connectors:
</p>

</div>
<p>
	It was quite behaviour behavivour given that there is no code
	commanding move beyond 90 degrees. Issue turned out to be caused by
	multi-threaded code which most likely corrupted internal state of
	Dynamixel library. Luckily none of critical parts were broken.
</p>
<p>
	Other issue was that I managed to break a metal screw while trying to
	screw it into plastic hole:
</p>
<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="image" src="broken-screw.jpg" alt="Broken screw"/>
</div>
<p>
	Closer inspection revealed that diameter of this screw was 0.2mm bigger
	than other screws used for the same diameter holes but it is still
	surprising that
	<a href="https://amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07C7WWX8Z/?tag=wishinfinit09-21">PLA</a>
	won against metal.
</p>
<p>
	Most worrying issue is that one of bearings started making noise and
	moving it by hand feels like scratching metal with a sharp object.
	Visually there is nothing wrong with a bearing yet. It is not
	surprising because this bearing experiences both radial and axial
	load and in this case
	<a href="https://www.bearingboys.co.uk/Crossed-Cylindrical-Roller/CRBH208AUUT1-IKO-Crossed-Cylindrical-Roller-Bearing-20mm-x-36mm-x-8mm-162240-p">crossed roller bearing</a>
	should be used instead. Small crossed roller bearings is not something
	your could buy cheaply on AliExpress though. Especially of small size I
	need. So I hoped that cheap
	<a href="https://amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07M7NLRKT/?tag=wishinfinit09-21">deep groove ball bearing</a>
	will be able to handle less than 2kg robot but looks like it is failing
	just after few hours of total operation time. Or maybe it was defective
	bearing to start with. Lets see how long other one lasts. If you know
	where to buy "affordable" crossed roller bearing (ideally with inner
	diameter of around 20mm) please
	<a href="https://naminukas.kikaitachi.com/contact">let me know</a>. Any
	size <a href="https://naminukas.kikaitachi.com/donate">donation would be appreciated</a> too.
