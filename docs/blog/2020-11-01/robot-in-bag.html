<h1>Robot than can move even placed in a bag and submerged underwater</h1>
<h2>2020-11-01</h2>
<p>
	In <a href="https://youtu.be/WPTIMjggux0">previous videos</a> it was demonstrated how the robot can move like a
	caterpillar by periodically tilting its feet back and forth out of phase
	with each other. Such motion allows the robot to traverse narrow passages.
	This video demonstrates another advantage of such motion. Since robot's feet
	in this mode of locomotion doesn't need to turn full circle, robot would be
	able to move even if enclosed in a flexible material. For example, putting
	the robot in a plastic bag, waterproofs it without affecting ability to move.
