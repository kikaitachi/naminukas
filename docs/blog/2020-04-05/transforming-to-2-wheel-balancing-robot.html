<h1>Transforming to 2 wheel balancing robot</h1>
<h2>2020-04-05</h2>
<p>
	This week's challenge was to attack the number one enemy of pneumatic
	robot -	soft and porous surface. The most obvious example at home is a
	carpet. Here is a video demonstrating how naminukas can transform from
	walking mode to two wheel balancing robot mode:

</div>
<p>
	Currently robot can only balance in place. Next steps are to tune PID
	for a better stability, implement movement control and think of a
	mechanism which would allow robot to transform between modes on its own
	without me holding it in the air. Also adding some kind of soft tyres
	on 3D printed wheels should help robot not to slip on hard surfaces.
