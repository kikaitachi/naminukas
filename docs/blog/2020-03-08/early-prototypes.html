<p>
  Idea was to have 2 legged robot. Each leg has 2 degrees of freedom and can be
  independently connected to vacuum pump to stick to the surface or vented to
  unstick. Here is an image of an early prototype:

  Small and cheap vacuum pump (black box at the bottom right corner) proven to
  work only on very smooth surfaces like ceramic tile or table. Floating floor
  and plaster wall proven to be too challenging to a small pump.
