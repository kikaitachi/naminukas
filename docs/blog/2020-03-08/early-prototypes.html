<h1>Early prototypes</h1>
<h2>2020-03-08</h2>
<p>
  Idea was to have 2 legged robot. Each leg has 2 degrees of freedom and can be
  independently connected to vacuum pump to stick to the surface or vented to
  unstick. Here is an image of an early prototype:
</p>
<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="image" src="early-prototype.jpg" alt="early prototype of pneumatic wall climbing robot"/>
</div>
<p>
  Small and cheap vacuum pump (black box at the bottom right corner) proven to
  work only on very smooth surfaces like ceramic tile or table. Floating floor
  and plaster wall proven to be too challenging for a small pump.
</p>
<p>
  40g hobby servo was proven to have insufficient torque therefore 2 servos per
  axis prototype was made:
</p>
<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="image" src="double-servo-setup.jpg" alt="2 servos per axis"/>
</div>
<p>
  Next image demonstrates another idea to make robot even more versatile:
</p>
<div class="imageContainer">
  <img class="image" src="wheel-mode.jpg" alt="early prototype in wheel mode"/>
</div>
<p>
  Axis which holds vacuum suction cup (to be attached to blue pipe at center
  right) can be turned 90 degrees which transforms robot for 2 legs to 2 wheels
  effectively making it 2 wheel balancing robot.
