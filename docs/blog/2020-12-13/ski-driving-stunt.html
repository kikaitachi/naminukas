<h1>Ski driving stunt</h1>
<h2>2020-12-13</h2>
<p>
	Skiing is an automotive driving stunt where the car is driven while balanced
	only on two wheels, either the pair on the driver side or on the passenger
	side. Since only 2 wheels are used to perform this stunt, I decided to try it
	on naminukas robot. Opposite to the car, this robot's center of gravity is
	quite high, therefore robot tilts only a little bit. The robot uses an onboard
	accelerometer and gyroscope to determine to which side it is falling, and
	tilts wheels accordingly to maintain the balance. Oscillations could probably
	be minimised by better PID tuning. Currently, only proportional and
	derivative parts are being used.Steering is implemented by turning wheels at
	different speeds.

	Unfortunately, while filming this video, I accidentally plugged my laptop
	charger to the robot's BeagleBone Blue charging port, which fried the charging
	circuit. Surprisingly, it seems that nothing else was fried, but I can't
	charge my robot any more :( Here is the damage:</p>
