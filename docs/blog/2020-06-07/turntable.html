<h1>Turntable</h1>
<h2>2020-06-07</h2>
<p>
	This week I was trying to make a more professional video about
	naminukas. Here is a result:
</p>
<div class="youTubeContainer">
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4SFp7ZuhQvI" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>
	This is my first video ever with a soundtrack instead of "natural"
	noise generated	by a vacuum pump. For the introduction I wanted to make
	a cool effect of camera rotating around robot. For that I made a super
	simple turntable from various scrap parts. Here is my video setup:
</p>
<div class="imageContainer">
	<img class="image" src="video-setup.jpg" alt="Video setup"/>
</div>
<p>
	It is probably the lowest tech contraption I ever made:
</p>
<div class="imageContainer">
	<img class="image" src="turntable-mechanism.jpg" alt="Turntable from scrap"/>
</div>
<p>
	At the bottom there is a leg from old shower tray screwed to the wooden
	plank. At the top I was lucky enough to find a nut with attached big
	washer which can spin freely. I believe it came from big old speaker.
	Since washer is still too small to reliably hold heavy object I clamped
	it with old 3D printed parts from naminukas. Table top is just part of
	ceramic tile left over from last renovation project with a surface
	nice enough to appear in the video.
