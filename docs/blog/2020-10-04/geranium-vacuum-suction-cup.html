	Finally I managed to buy an industrial foam rubber vacuum suction cup
	made of material called Geranium. I bought only rubber part and
	3D-printed cup myself. Here is a result:

	Rubber is very soft and it is supposed to allow grabbing of not
	completely flat surfaces. My ultimate goal was to allow the robot to
	climb on a brick wall. Unfortunately this rubber seems to leak
	quite a lot of air so I think it is optimized for industrial
	vacuum pumps with high air flow capabilities and might be not
	usable with small mobile pump.

	I will go back to experimenting with <a href="/blog/2020-09-06/rubber-foam-suction-cup">neoprene rubber foam</a>
	because it is cheap, readily available and did show promising results.
	I just need to find a better way to cut it. Hot wire seems to be not an
	option according to <a href="https://www.thefoamfactory.com/blog/index.php/cut-foam-easily-with-these-diy-closed-cell-foam-cutting-tips">this</a>
	article.
