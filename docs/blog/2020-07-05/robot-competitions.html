<h1>Robot competitions</h1>
<h2>2020-07-05</h2>
<p>
	Recently I was looking for robot competitions I could aim to
	participate with naminukas. Reading competition requirements
	gives me ideas which feature I should work on next. Unfortunately I
	couldn't find any comprehensive and up to date list of robot
	competitions. So I decided to create <a href="https://competitions.kikaitachi.com/">my own</a>.
	It is a minimalistic list inpired by <a href="http://genretv.blogspot.com/">Fantasy/Sci-Fi TV Show Start Dates</a>.
