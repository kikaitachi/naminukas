	Until recently I have controlled naminukas robot either from a desktop
	computer during development or from a laptop during experiments. Since
	<a href="https://beagleboard.org/blue">BeagleBone Blue</a> board can
	act as WiFi access point it is easy to connect to the robot anywhere
	even then no other networks are available. When I tried this solution
	<a href="https://youtu.be/XXZjXcNF9N4">on the beach</a> during bright
	sunny day I immediately understood drawback	of this remote control
	solution. Screen readability is severely affected by the direct sunlight.
	Extensive use of keyboard shortcuts in my web based control UI helped a lot
	but even finding the right key was a challenge. After all
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_goggles">sunglasses</a> (see
	image on the right) were invented because it is hard to look at anything on
	the bright sunny day.

	This experience led me to buy my first hobby RC radio. Given variety of
	radio brands, protocols, controllers and receivers it was a daunting task
	to choose what to buy. I ended up with <a href="https://radiomasterrc.com/Radio-TX16S-MAX.html">RadioMaster TX16S MAX</a>. My goal was to have 2 way
	communication between controller and robot. But even after hours of
	research I ended up buying SBUS capable receiver (see image on the left) just to discover that
	SBUS supports only controller to receiver communication. I had to bit-bang
	SBUS protocol in BeagleBone Blue PRU unit. Documentation both about SBUS
	and PRU is sparse and took countless days to get working. Here is proof of
	concept implementation: <a href="https://github.com/kikaitachi/naminukas-brain/blob/main/pru_firmware/sbus.pru0.c">https://github.com/kikaitachi/naminukas-brain/blob/main/pru_firmware/sbus.pru0.c</a>. Eventually I figured out that F.Port capable
	receiver is what would allow me to have bidirectional communication between
	controller and the robot. So I bought <a href="https://www.jumper-rc.com/products/receivers/r1f/">Jumper R1F F.Port receiver</a>.
	It was not so hard to get it working one way as in
	a way F.Port is just "better" SBUS. I am still working on getting telemetry
	from the robot to the controller but I though I should document process so
	far to help someone on the same journey as I was.

	First I would like to say that having proper tools to analyse signals was
	probably more useful than Google on this subject. I was lucky to have
	access quite expensive but totally worth it piece of equipment called
	<a href="https://www.saleae.com/">Salea Logic Analyser</a>.
