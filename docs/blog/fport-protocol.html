	Until recently I have controlled Naminukas robot either from a desktop
	computer during development or from a laptop during experiments. Since
	<a href="https://beagleboard.org/blue">BeagleBone Blue</a> board can
	act as WiFi access point it is easy to connect to the robot anywhere
	even then no other networks are available. When I tried this solution
	<a href="https://youtu.be/XXZjXcNF9N4">on the beach</a> during bright
	sunny day I immediately understood drawback: screen readability is
	severely affected by the direct sunlight. Extensive use of keyboard
	shortcuts in my web based control UI helped a lot but even finding the
	right key on the keyboard was a challenge. After all
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses">sunglasses</a>
	(see image on the right) were invented because it is hard to look at
	anything on	the bright sunny day.

</div>
<p>
	This experience led me to buy not sunglasses but my first hobby RC radio.
	Dedicated mechanical gimbals and switches makes it natural to move robot
	without looking at the controls. Given variety of radio brands, protocols,
	controllers and	receivers it was a daunting task to choose what to buy. I
	ended up with <a href="https://radiomasterrc.com/Radio-TX16S-MAX.html">
	RadioMaster TX16S MAX</a>. My goal was to have 2 way communication between
	controller and robot. But even after hours of research I ended up buying
	SBUS capable receiver (see image on the left) just to discover that SBUS
	supports only controller to receiver communication. I had to bit-bang SBUS
	protocol in	BeagleBone Blue PRU unit. Documentation both about SBUS	and
	PRU is sparse and it took countless hours to get working
	<a href="https://github.com/kikaitachi/naminukas-brain/blob/main/pru_firmware/sbus.pru0.c">
	proof of concept implementation</a>. Eventually I figured out that F.Port
	capable receiver is what would allow me to have bidirectional communication
	between controller and the robot. So I bought
	<a href="https://www.jumper-rc.com/products/receivers/r1f/">Jumper R1F
	F.Port receiver</a> (see setup image bellow). It was not so hard to get
	it working <a href="https://github.com/kikaitachi/naminukas-brain/blob/main/pru_firmware/fport.pru0.c">
	one way</a> as in a way F.Port is just "better" SBUS. I am still working on
	getting telemetry from the robot to the controller but I though	I should
	document process so far to help someone on the same journey as I was.

<h2>Experimental setup</h2>
<p>
	First, I would like to say that having proper tools to analyse signals was
	probably more useful than Google on this subject. Here is my setup to debug
	F.Port signals:
</p>
<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center; font-size: 75%;">

	<br/>F.Port debugging setup
</div>
<p>
	I was lucky to have
	access quite expensive but totally worth it piece of equipment called
	<a href="https://www.saleae.com/">Saleae Logic Analyser</a>. Saleae Logic
	Analyser allows to capture up to 8 input signals (even more expensive 16 channel
	version is available too) and display/analyse them on computer via USB
	connection. It captures both analog and digital signals so it can replace
	osciloscope in some cases. Computer side software is called <a href="https://www.saleae.com/downloads/">Logic</a>
	and is available for Linux, Mac and Windows. It is very simple and intuitive
	to use. There is no need to even install it. You just download a single file
	and run it. What is the most useful in my opinion is the ability to annotate
	captured signals. For example, it can decode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter</a>
	(UART),	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface">Serial Peripheral Interface</a>
	(SPI) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C">Inter-Integrated Circuit</a>
	(IÂ²C) signals and display which part the signal corresponds to which byte.
	Here is an example of F.Port signal decoded as UART:
</p>

	<img class="image" src="../images/f.port-uart.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" alt="Decoded UART signal"/>
	<br/>Decoded UART signal
</div>
<p>
	At the bottom "A0" channel shows analog signal which is not interesting for
	us in this case except to check if device operates at 3.3V or 5V. At the top
	"D0" channel represents digital signal. At the very top pink boxes indicate
	decoded UART bytes. White dots indicate where data bits are.

</p>
<h2>What is F.Port protocol?</h2>
<p>
	F.Port is a single wire bus which uses inverted UART with speed 115200 bits / second,
	8 data bits, one start bit, one stop bit and no parity. These are required settings
	to decode signal in Saleae Logic software:

</div>
<p>
	Protocol defines the following 3 frames:
</p>
<table class="table">
<caption>Control frame</caption>
<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>Head</th>
		<th>Len</th>
		<th>Type</th>
		<th>Channel frame</th>
		<th>CRC</th>
		<th>End</th>
	</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>0x7E</td>
		<td>0x19</td>
		<td>0x00</td>
		<td>[data1][data2] ... [data22][flags][RSSI]</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>0x7E</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table class="table">
	<caption>Downlink data frame</caption>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Head</th>
			<th>Len</th>
			<th>Type</th>
			<th>Prime</th>
			<th>AppId low</th>
			<th>AppId high</th>
			<th>Data</th>
			<th>CRC</th>
			<th>End</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>0x7E</td>
			<td>0x08</td>
			<td>0x01</td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td>0x7E</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<table class="table">
	<caption>Uplink data frame</caption>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Len</th>
			<th>Type</th>
			<th>Prime</th>
			<th>AppId low</th>
			<th>AppId high</th>
			<th>Data</th>
			<th>CRC</th>

	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>0x08</td>
			<td>0x81</td>

		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>
	Control frame is used to send channel data from radio controller to the
	receiver. 16 channels as send in 22 "data" bytes. Each channel uses 11 bits.
	There are 2 additional "digital" only channels which are send as 2 least
	significant bits of "flags" byte. Not all hardware supports them. "RSSI"
	byte stands for Received Signal	Strength Indicator. "CRC" is summed from
	"Len" field to the byte in front of "CRC".
</p>
<p>
	Downlink/Uplink data frames is what allows bidirectional communication.
	I am still working on implementing them in my robot and I will add more
	information about them here or in the next blog entry in the future.

<h2>Saleae Logic Extensions</h2>
<p>
	While UART annotations in Saleae Logic are very useful, it would be even
	more useful if it could understand not only generic UART but the underlying
	F.Port protocol too. For that reason Saleae Logic supports extensions. For
	example, Dynamixel servo motors also use UART and there is and extension
	which on top of UART decoding shows which byte means what in the underlying
	protocol. For example:
</p>
<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center; font-size: 75%;">
	<img class="image" src="../images/saleae-dynamixel.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" alt="Decoded Dynamixel protocol"/>
	<br/>Decoded Dynamixel protocol
</div>
<p>
	I found Dynamixel protocol extension very useful and given there was no
	extension for F.Port yet, I decided to write <a href="https://github.com/kikaitachi/fport-decoder">my own</a>.
	It was not hard to write. Saleae has <a href="https://support.saleae.com/extensions">extensive documentation</a>
	about extensions. Extensions are publicly hosted on GitHub so there are
	plenty of examples to learn from. Extension code needs to be written in
	<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. Here is an example of my
	extension in action:
</p>
<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center; font-size: 75%;">
	<img class="image" src="../images/f.port-decoded-channels.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" alt="F.Port decoded channels"/>
	<br/>F.Port decoded channels
</div>
<p>
	As you can see extensions can operate not only on bytes. For example,
	blue channel boxes ("ch1", "ch2", "ch3") span bits they represent.
	This aids a lot for debugging and understanding data. Here is an example
	of decoded "flags" bits:
</p>
<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center; font-size: 75%;">
	<img class="image" src="../images/f.port-decoded-flags.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px;" alt="F.Port decoded flags"/>
	<br/>F.Port decoded flags
</div>
<p>
	My "F.Port decoder" extension is already included in official extensions,
	so you can install it as any other with a single click:
</p>
<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center; font-size: 75%;">
	<img class="image" src="../images/f.port-decoder-extension.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 900px;" alt="F.Port decoder extension"/>
	<br/>F.Port decoder extension
</div>
<p>
	I hope it will be useful for someone and I am looking forward to create more.
