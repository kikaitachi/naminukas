<h1>Autonomous transition between walk and drive mode</h1>
<h2>2020-04-26</h2>
<p>
	Robot was able to transform from walking to driving mode for a while
	(see <a href="/blog/2020-04-05/transforming-to-2-wheel-balancing-robot">this blog post</a>)
	but I was looking how to do it autonomously without holding robot in
	the air. After a lot of	experimentation and some hardware changes I
	figured out how to make	robot to balance during transformation:

</div>
<p>
	For balancing to work on hard surface I had to put rubber tires on
	wheels otherwise robot would slip too much with plastic wheels. Wheel
	design had to undergo few iterations to make sure tires themselves
	don't slip from wheels sideways during transformation. Even in the
	latest design tires do come off the wheels occasionally so more
	improvements are needed for a final design.
