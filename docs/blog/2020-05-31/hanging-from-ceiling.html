<h1>Hanging from the ceiling</h1>
<h2>2020-05-31</h2>
<p>
	A while ago I have tested if suction cups of naminukas are strong enough for hanging from
	<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07BN4JTLT/?tag=wishinfinit09-21">plaster board</a>
	ceiling. Answer is yes, but I didn't make any decent video showing that because any mistake
	which could result in robot falling from ceiling height would most
	likely result in Â£1000+ of broken parts. Since I think it is quite an
	impressive capability and also end goal to make robot safely traverse
	most of indoor places I risked to make a small demonstration on top of
	the bed: 
</p>
<div class="youTubeContainer">

</div>
<p>
	To make more sophisticated activities than just turning safe, I need to
	improve sensing if suction cup of one leg reached sufficient vacuum
	level before lifting other feet. On the ground inertial measurement unit
	is sufficient to detect if leg was stuck to surface or not as explained
	in <a href="/blog/2020-04-19/detecting-carpet">Detecting carpet blog entry</a>.
	Such solution is not an option on wall or ceiling. Most obvious solution
	is to add pressure sensors to each feet. That is on my list to explore.
	There are few indirect measurement alternatives:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Infer if required vacuum level is reached by trying to lift a
		leg and observing servo motor current. Depending on vacuum level
		it would be easy or hard/impossible to lift a leg and motor
		current would reflect that. This would be the most desirable
		solution as it doesn't require any new hardware therefore
		doesn't add any weight or cost.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you don't mute my videos with horrible noise you probably noticed that
		noise changes when foot is up and vacuum pump just sucks the air and when
		foot is down and vacuum is being generated. I am planning to add
		<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0748NCPN5/?tag=wishinfinit09-21">webcam with a microphone</a>
		to robot in the future. This could be a great opportunity to try
		some machine learning for mapping noise to pressure.
	</li>
