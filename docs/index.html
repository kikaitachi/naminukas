<h1>About</h1>
<p>
	Naminukas is an ultimate indoor robot which can explore almost any part
	of the house including climbing on walls, ceiling and furniture. Robot
	is able to transform to either a bipedal walking robot which can hold
	on any hard flat surface with vacuum suction cups or a two wheel
	balancing robot which can drive on soft and porous surfaces like a carpet.
	Robot can be also used as 4 degrees of freedom pick & place arm. It
	even caries detachable tools which can be picked and used by feet.
