<h1 id="about">Goal</h1>
<p>To create a robot which can navigate and reach most of places of a typical human building. For example robot must be able to navigate to a different floor and reach window sill.</p>
<h2>Assumptions & constraints</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Typical human building is made of mostly flat, hard and othogonal surfaces.</li>
	<li>Building has atmosphere.</li>
	<li>Robot would be "portable":
		<ul>
			<li>Have weight under 2kg</li>
			<li>Don't exceed 30cm in any dimension</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="prototype">Prototype</h1>
<p>
	In order to achieve goal with contraints above, I have chosen to make a
	pneumatic robot. Here is initial prototype in action:

</div>
<p>
	Vacuum suction cups allows robot to "stick" not only to floot but also
	to wall and ceilings. Wall and ceilings are often less cluttered than
	floor so it might be easier to utilize them instead of climbing strairs.
</p>
<h1 id="donate">Donate</h1>
<p>
	I want to make this project open source but because of expensive parts and a
	lot of invested time I plan to do it gradually when/if there are enough people
	interested in this project. Therefore I have set the following milestones:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>When donations will reach £100, I will release list parts used in this robot.</li>
	<li>When donations will reach £1000, I will release scad files for all 3D printed parts.</li>
	<li>When donations will reach £10000, I will release software which controls the robot.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
<dl>
	<dt>What is the meaning of robot name "naminukas"?</dt>
	<dd>
		"naminukas" is a Lithuanian word for a magical spirit which
		lives in peoples homes, guards and heals them. This matches
		well with the purpose of the robot: robot should be able act
		as mobile camera for security, could have a sensor payload to
		monitor various parameters like presence of harmful gasses or
		radiation and potentially perfom more useful task with addition
		or manipulator arm.

	<dt>Is project open source?</dt>
	<dd>Yes, eventually. See <a href="#donate">donate</a> section.</dd>
