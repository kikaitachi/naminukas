<h1>About</h1>
<p>
	Purpose of this project is to create a robot which can easily navigate
	inside buildings by walking on hard flat floor, walls or even ceiling.
	Here is a prototype in action:
	<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKrlKRcPvp4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	</div>
</p>
<p>
	For a small robot it is hard to climb stairs and next to impossible to
	reach high places like window sill without flying or climbing walls.
	Solution is to use vacuum suction grippers which allow to stick to
	hard flat surfaces like floor, walls and ceiling. Luckily most of human
	inhabited buildings consist of hard flat and orthogonal surfaces -
	ideal for vacuum suction grippers.
</p>
<p>
	Motivation for such a robot is to have a versatile mobile platform for
	indoor automation. Potential applications could be:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Mobile camera which can be operated remotely. While
			<a href="https://amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07XR2NWZC/?tag=wishinfinit09-21">cameras with pan and tilt</a>
			mechanism are cheap and	omnipresent they can never
			replace truly mobile platform which can perform close up inspection.
		</li>
		<li>
			Mobile camera can be suplemented by various sensors
			for inspecting hazardous or hard to reach environments.
		</li>
		<li>
			Adding manupulator or other tools would allow to
			perform maintenace tasks is high places where <a href="https://amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07BLKRCNP/?tag=wishinfinit09-21">ladder</a>
			or scaffolding are impractical.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Self-imposed design constrains are:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Weight should be about 2kg: 1.5kg for robot itself and
			0.5kg for a payload.</li>
		<li>
			Size should not exceed 30cm in any dimension, i.e.
			portable in <a href="https://amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01N9QBWNX/?tag=wishinfinit09-21">hand luggage</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>
