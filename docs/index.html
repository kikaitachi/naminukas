<h1>About</h1>
<p>
	Purpose of this project is to create a portable robot which can easily
	navigate inside buildings. For a small robot it is hard to climb stairs
	and next to impossible to reach high places like window sill without
	flying. Small flying machine can't carry a significant payload and
	large flying machine is inherently unsafe to operate indoors. Solution
	is to use vacuum suction grippers which allow to stick to hard flat
	surfaces like floor, walls and ceiling.	Here is a prototype in action:

<p>
	While most of buildings consist of hard flat and orthogonal surfaces -
	ideal for vacuum suction grippers, soft and porous surfaces like a
	carpet are very common too. Solution is to use vacuum suction grippers
	as wheels and transform walking robot to two wheel balancing robot.

<p>
	Dual mode of operation makes such robot a very versatile mobile
	platform for indoor automation. Potential applications could be:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Mobile camera which can be operated remotely. While
		<a href="https://amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07XR2NWZC/?tag=wishinfinit09-21">cameras with pan and tilt</a>
		mechanism are cheap and	omnipresent they can never
		replace truly mobile platform which can perform close up inspection.
	</li>
	<li>
		Mobile camera can be supplemented by various sensors
		for inspecting hazardous or hard to reach environments.
	</li>
	<li>
		Adding manipulation or other tools would allow to
		perform maintenance tasks is high places where <a href="https://amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07BLKRCNP/?tag=wishinfinit09-21">ladder</a>
		or scaffolding are impractical.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Self-imposed design constrains are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Weight should be about 2kg: 1.5kg for robot itself and 0.5kg
		for a payload. Currently prototype weights 1405g.
	</li>
	<li>
		Size should not exceed 30cm in any dimension, i.e. portable in
		<a href="https://amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01N9QBWNX/?tag=wishinfinit09-21">hand luggage</a>.
	</li>
</ul>
