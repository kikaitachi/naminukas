<p>
	Purpose of this project is to create a robot which can easily navigate
	inside buildings by walking on hard flat floor, walls or even ceiling.
	Here is a prototype in action:
	<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKrlKRcPvp4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	</div>
</p>
<p>
	For a small robot it is hard to climb stairs and next to impossible to
	reach high places like window sill without flying or climbing walls.
	Solution is to use vacuum suction grippers which allow to stick to
	hard flat surfaces like floor, walls and ceiling. Luckily most of human
	inhabited buildings consist of hard flat and orthogonal surfaces -
	ideal for vacuum suction grippers.
</p>
<p>
	Motivation for such a robot is to have a versatile mobile platform for
	indoor automation. Potential applications could be:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Mobile camera which can be operated remotely. While
			cameras with pan and tilt mechanism are cheap and
			omnipresent they can never replace truly mobile platform
			which can perform close up inspection.
		</li>
		<li>
			Mobile camera can be suplemented by various sensors
			for inspecting hazardous environments or hard to reach.
		</li>
		<li>
			Adding manupulator or other tools would allow to
			perform maintenace tasks is high places where ladder or
			scaffolding are impractical.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Currect self-imposed design constrains are:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Weight should be about 2kg: 1.5kg for robot itself and
			0.5kg for a payload.</li>
		<li>
			Size should not exceed 30cm in any dimension.
		</li>
	</ul>

	I want to make this project open source but because of expensive parts and a
	lot of invested time I plan to do it gradually when/if there are enough people
	interested in this project. Therefore I have set the following milestones:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>When donations will reach £100, I will release list parts used in this robot.</li>
	<li>When donations will reach £1000, I will release scad files for all 3D printed parts.</li>
	<li>When donations will reach £10000, I will release software which controls the robot.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
	<dt>What is the meaning of robot name "naminukas"?</dt>
	<dd>
		"naminukas" is a Lithuanian word for a magical spirit which
		lives in peoples homes, guards and heals them. This matches
		well with the purpose of the robot: robot should be able act
		as mobile camera for security, could have a sensor payload to
		monitor various parameters like presence of harmful gasses or
		radiation and potentially perfom more useful task with addition
		of manipulator arm.

	<dt>Is project open source?</dt>
	<dd>Yes, eventually. See <a href="#donate">donate</a> section.</dd>
